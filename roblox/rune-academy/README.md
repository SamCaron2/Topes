# Rune Academy

Incremental/idle Roblox game.

> **Full reset in progress.** The Mana/Coins economy and its world
> (kiosks, floor tiles, the Rune Altar) were scrapped on request — the
> world is back to just a baseplate, `GameConfig.Zones` and
> `AscensionTiers` are empty, and every `StarterPlayerScripts` file was
> removed. Everything below `## What's still here` describes the reusable
> backend infrastructure that survived the reset (Runes, Titles, Power
> Store, the generic ResourceEngine); the sections after that describe
> the OLD scrapped design and are kept only as reference for mechanics
> that may come back, not as a description of the current game. A new
> vision is being defined from scratch, one piece at a time.

See `DESIGN.md` for the full (mostly historical, pending rewrite) system
design notes.

## Setup (do this on your gaming PC Monday)

1. Install [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/) if you haven't.
2. Install [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) — either the VS Code extension +
   the `rojo` CLI (`cargo install rojo` or download from GitHub releases),
   or just the Studio plugin from the Roblox plugin marketplace ("Rojo").
3. Create a new blank Studio place, save it inside this `rune-academy/`
   folder (e.g. `rune-academy/RuneAcademy.rbxl`).
4. From this folder, run:
   ```
   rojo serve
   ```
5. In Studio, open the Rojo plugin panel and click **Connect**. Everything
   in `src/` will sync into the place.
6. Studio should now show just the baseplate — nothing auto-generates a
   world right now (see the reset note above). Building starts fresh once
   the new vision is specified.

## What's still here (survived the reset)

- `GameConfig.lua` — every tunable number lives here: the multi-currency
  `Zones` config (upgrades, self-prestige tiers, chain resets, floor
  tiles), stat definitions, Rune rarity odds + boosts, Ascension tiers.
  Change balance here, not in the handler scripts.
- `NumberFormat.lua` — K/M/B/T/Qd/... suffix formatting for big numbers.
- `PlayerData.lua` — DataStore load/save/autosave, leaderstats, and
  `defaultData()` builds every zone/currency's save-data shape straight
  from `GameConfig.Zones` (add a currency to config, its save slot exists
  automatically — no separate PlayerData change needed).
- `ResourceEngine.lua` — the generic engine every currency runs on:
  server-authoritative collect (click/stand, distance + debounce checked),
  buy upgrade (one/max), self-prestige, chain reset, sell (see below), and
  floor tile purchases. All currencies go through this one module. An
  upgrade slot's `kind` changes what its levels do: `"yield"` (default)
  multiplies that currency's own production; `"tickInterval"` instead
  controls how often `collect()` can fire (a real duration, e.g. Mana's
  1.0s → 0.1s Scrap Respawn upgrade), read via
  `getCollectDebounceSeconds`; `"sellRate"` boosts a `sellInto` conversion
  rate instead of production. A slot's `costCurrency` (optional, defaults
  to the currency it's on) lets it be bought with a DIFFERENT currency —
  e.g. all of Mana's upgrades cost Coins, matching the reference game.
  `sellInto` is a separate mechanic from `chainReset`: it converts ANY
  amount of a currency into another at an upgradeable rate, at ANY time
  (no threshold, no upgrade reset) — Mana → Coins uses this, not a
  chain reset, since you can cash out partial Mana whenever you want.
- `RuneHandler.lua` — server-authoritative gacha pull, Fortune-weighted odds.
- `ResetHandler.lua` — Ascension only (per-currency resets live in
  ResourceEngine now). `GameConfig.AscensionTiers` is empty right now, so
  `ascend()` just returns "No further Ascension tiers" — safe no-op, not
  a bug.
- `Main.server.lua` — wires up RemoteEvents/Functions between client and
  the handlers above.
- `StoreHandler.lua` — the Power Store. Processes GamePass and Developer
  Product purchases server-side, grants stat multipliers/Gems/Scrolls/an
  instant Ascension, tracks Robux spent for the leaderboard, and guards
  against double-granting a retried purchase.
- `TitleHandler.lua` — unlocks and equips Titles (`GameConfig.Titles`),
  mirrors the equipped one onto Player attributes.
- `FriendBoostHandler.lua` — tracks how many of a player's Roblox friends
  are in the same server (live, never saved); `ResourceEngine` applies
  `GameConfig.FriendBoost` on top of any currency flagged
  `friendBoost = true`, once a currency has that flag again.

- `WorldBuilder.server.lua` — generates world content on server start.
  Currently the 60x60 Mana collection platform (a hollow square outline,
  4 thin Neon parts, non-collide, centered on `SpawnLocation`) plus a
  single Mana cube inside it: touch it for +1 Mana, it respawns at a new
  random spot inside the zone ~2 seconds later. Grows one piece at a time
  as the new vision gets specified — rerunning it (every server start)
  rebuilds the `ManaZone` folder from scratch, so editing this file and
  reconnecting Rojo is how you iterate on world layout.
- `ManaHandler.lua` — server-authoritative Mana collection and its one
  upgrade so far: "Mana Per Pickup" (level 1-20, +1 Mana per pickup per
  level, level costs `level * 10` Mana — a placeholder linear curve).
  Deliberately kept separate from `ResourceEngine`/`GameConfig.Zones` for
  now — a fresh, much simpler mechanic until the new vision needs more.
- `ManaHUDClient.client.lua` — a plain "Mana: <amount>" text label,
  middle-left of the screen, updated live off the `ManaUpdated`
  RemoteEvent. No icon yet.
- `ManaRingClient.client.lua` — a small dashed ring under the player's
  feet, visible only while standing inside the `ManaZone` platform
  bounds (read off attributes `WorldBuilder` sets on that folder:
  `CenterX`/`CenterZ`/`Size`/`GroundY`). `RING_RADIUS` is the one number
  to bump later for a "bigger collection ring" upgrade.
- `ManaYieldKioskClient.client.lua` — the first 3D upgrade card, standing
  just outside the platform (`Workspace.Kiosks.ManaYieldKiosk`, sized
  bigger than one upgrade needs so more slots can go on the same board
  later). Its BillboardGui (studs-sized, shrinks with distance, offset in
  front of the card's face via `StudsOffsetWorldSpace` so it doesn't
  visually clip through the card's real geometry as the camera moves)
  shows the current "Mana Per Pickup" level, current yield, and a Buy
  button for the next level, wired to
  `GetManaYieldState`/`BuyManaYieldUpgrade`.

## Manual steps required before everything works

1. **Power Store**: `GameConfig.DevProducts` and `GameConfig.GamePasses`
   list every product with a placeholder `id = 0`. In Studio: **Home →
   Monetize** (or the game's page on the Creator Dashboard) → create each
   GamePass and Developer Product listed there with matching prices, then
   paste the real asset ID back into `GameConfig.lua`. Nothing will prompt
   a real purchase until that's done — `StoreHandler.promptPurchase`
   silently no-ops on `id = 0` on purpose, so a half-configured store can't
   accidentally prompt Studio's test/placeholder asset IDs.
2. **Titles**: three `GameConfig` values are placeholders until you fill
   them in —
   - `ReleaseTimestampUnix` (nil right now): set to the real launch time so
     the OG title means something. The OG condition never unlocks while
     this is nil.
   - `FanGroupId` (0 right now): your Roblox group's id, for the Fan title.
   - `OwnerUserIds` / `AdminUserIds` / `TesterUserIds` (all empty): add your
     own UserId to `OwnerUserIds` so you get the Owner title on join.

## One-time cleanup if Studio still shows old world parts

Nothing server-side generates or removes world parts anymore. If your
saved `.rbxl` still has leftover parts from before the reset (e.g. a
saved-while-in-Play-mode `GeneratedWorld` folder or similar), delete them
by hand in Workspace — they're just leftover geometry, nothing references
them.

## Not yet built (next steps)

Everything client-facing and every currency/zone. `GameConfig.Zones` and
`GameConfig.AscensionTiers` are empty, `StarterPlayerScripts` is empty,
and there's no world content at all beyond the baseplate. The plan is to
rebuild one piece at a time as the new vision is specified — nothing
speculative gets added ahead of that.

An in-game admin command to grant Tester/Admin manually (instead of only
via the `GameConfig` UserId allowlists), OrderedDataStore-backed
leaderboards, and a community-codes module are still open ideas from the
old design and may or may not carry over — see DESIGN.md for the
(historical) detail.
